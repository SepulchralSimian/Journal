# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:

### Summative Narrative: 

Constructed the section "What's Experimental About New Complexity?" Drafted the text for this section, which I hope will resolve some of the issues about opacity by breaking down the component pieces of my project into easily graspable descriptions.

Wrote the section on "What is Jazz Harmony?" Uploaded to website.

Started another section called "Whence Fusion?", which will give a history of fusion.
