# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:

### Summative Narrative: 
My primary objectives and accomplishments this first week were the collection and reading of references and the refinement of the scope of my project. I also had to acquire and begin to learn how to use Dorico, which is a music notation software. I spent some time finding a free open-source outlet to publish .md files online. All references collected over the course of the 13 weeks are contained under "References."
