# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:

### Summative Narrative: 

Further website development. Created link to "What is New Complexity?" Spent time looking for a single composition that I can include to give viewers a sense of the genre. Added it to the website. Discovered the composer [mannfish](https://twitter.com/mannfishh), whose Twitter feed has become an extremely valuable repository of information on New Complexity. Need to come back and add some of this to the website. 

I studied the compositions included below:
