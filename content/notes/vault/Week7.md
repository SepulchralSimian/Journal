# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:

### Summative Narrative: 

Further website development. Created link to "What is New Complexity?" Spent time looking for a single composition that I can include to give viewers a sense of the genre. Added it to the website. Discovered the composer [mannfish](https://twitter.com/mannfishh), whose Twitter feed has become an extremely valuable repository of information on New Complexity. Need to come back and add some of this to the website. Studied the composition included below.
