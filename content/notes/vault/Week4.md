# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:
### Summative Narrative: 

This week I continued to develop the website and experiment with the Dorico software. I did some experimentation with composition. I have discovered that trying to compose with microtones is far more difficult than ordinary composing. Thus the need for complex notation.

I have been reading the text Brian Ferneyhough, which is of limited utility.
