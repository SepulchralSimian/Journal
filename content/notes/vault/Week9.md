# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:
### Summative Narrative: 

I was accepted to Pioneer Academics to pursue a college-level research project in the area of Music/Music Theory. I will be working with Jan Miyake ([https://www.oberlin.edu/jan-miyake](https://www.oberlin.edu/jan-miyake)), and hope to be able to expand upon this project in that context. Considering postponing the research paper/expository document component of this project to work on it in that context instead.
