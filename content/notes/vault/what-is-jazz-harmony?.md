Jazz harmony is the theory and practice of how chords are used in jazz music. A chord [link to audio] is a harmonic set of pitches that consists of multiple notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. Jazz is similar to other practices in the tradition of Western harmony. Chord progressions [audio link] and the use of major and minor scales [audio link] as a basis for chordal construction are commonly found in both. In jazz, chords are often arranged vertically in major or minor thirds [audio link], although stacked fourths [audio link] are also often found. Furthermore, jazz includes the addition of tensions, intervals such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords [audio links]. Unlike classical music, which favors the use of triads [audio link], jazz harmony tends towards the use of seventh chords [audio link] as the basic harmonic unit.
