# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:

### Summative Narrative: 

My primary objectives and accomplishments during the second week were to continue the collection and reading of references so as to better understand what New Complexity in fact is. I began to construct my website, which took about five hours of my time this week. I began to research serialism, particularly twelve-tone technique. I also spent time with applications of tuning systems of equal temperament (for example, microtonality).
