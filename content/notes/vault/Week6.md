# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:
### Summative Narrative: 

Experimented further with composing; trying to learn how to utilize the software effectively for this sort of music. I realized that I likely will not be able to compose the full composition due to this difficulty. In response to concerns about opacity with my project, I have resolved to create guiding questions to help organize the material and resolved to focus on this for the upcoming critique of the draft of my project.
