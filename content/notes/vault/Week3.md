# Reported Progress towards Project Completion:
### Summative Narrative: 

In addition to continuing to review collected references, I delved more deeply into one particular reference: a dissertation written by a PhD student at Cornell University in 2015. This has proven to be very useful and will inform some of what I write about New Complexity. Duncan asks what really unifies the various composers that constitute the genre. He examines Roger Regateâ€™s first published work, Genoi Hoios Essi for solo piano.
