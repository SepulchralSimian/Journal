title: New Jazz
---

###### *This site has been created to serve as a repository for all material relevant to my Junior Workshop Project.*

My project is an attempt to create a new fusion genre by applying the theoretical principles of jazz harmony to the school of New Complexity. I have created a single composition based on these principles--the first composition of what we might call "new jazz complexity," or perhaps "jazz complexity." I prefer to call it, more simply, "new jazz."
