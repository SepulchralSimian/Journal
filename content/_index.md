title: New Jazz
---

*This site has been created to serve as a repository for all material relevant to my Junior Workshop Project.*

My project is an attempt to create a new fusion genre by applying the principles of jazz theory to the genre of New Complexity. I have created a single composition based on these principles--the first composition of what we might call "new jazz complexity," or perhaps "jazz complexity." I prefer to call it, more simply, "new jazz." In order to understand the premise behind this fusion one has to also understand the theoretical principles that underwrite jazz.
