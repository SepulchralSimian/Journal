{"/":{"title":"New Jazz","content":"### An Experimental School of Music \n\nMy project is to produce a new fusionary genre by applying the theoretical principles of jazz harmony to the school of New Complexity. New Complexity identifies an avant-garde school of composers who, since the late 1970s, have produced compositions which, while often dissonant, abstract and atonal, require inventive methods of complex notation, often overwhelming to the eyes. By integrating the fundamental principles of jazz harmony into New Complexity, I have aimed to produce a novel fusion of the two seemingly disparate fields of music, and their respective theoretical frameworks. The elements involved in this project--my aims, intentions, and the central questions that propelled it--are detailed below.

Instead, Duncan asks: Where does complexity reside, if not in intensely complex notation? In other words, what is meant by complexity? \"Complexity,\" he clarifies, \"resides in the interstices between the composer and the score, score and performance, and performance and reception, in whose confluence 'the work' might be said to exist\".^1 Elaborating on this idea, the musicologist Harry Halbrich cautions us that we should not confuse complexity with complication, and that complexity is, he suggests, \"a prerequisite of any great art wishing to satisfy not only the sense and feelings, but also the mind.\"^2 New Complexity music, moreover, foregrounds what is cognitive about music by elaborating upon its theoretical premises to a new extreme.\n\n__  \n*(1) Barry Truax, “The Inner and Outer Complexity of Music,” Perspectives of New Music 32, no. 1 (1994): 176.*\n\n*(2) Duncan, S.

Ferneyhough was born in 1943 in England and taught at various institutions in the United States until landing at Stanford University, where he is now Professor Emeritus. There exists an enormous amount of discussion around Ferneyhough's intense intellectualism: he has been called a \"peculiarly mystifying verbalizer\" with a \"fearsome theoretical background.\" \n\n![ferneyhough](https://sepulchralsimian.github.io/quartz/notes/images/ferneyhough.jpeg)\n\nIf we can see past this haze of fearful and superficial responses to his work, we can begin to understand the ways in which New Complexity is fundamentally committed to exploring, in a deeply experimental way, the relationship between the musical score, the musical performance, and the cognitive experience of music. According to James Boros, New Complexity grew as a reaction against the “new simplicity,” with “composers and performers who, having peeked over the fence surrounding this dungheap, have determined that shoveling shit is not to be their fate.”\n\n![time](https://sepulchralsimian.github.io/quartz/notes/images/time.jpeg)\n\nAccording to the American musicologist Richard Taruskin, the complexity of the work of composers like Ferneyhough and others represents an effort to find \"notations for virtually impalpable microtones, ever-changing rhythmic divisions and tiny gradations of timbre and loudness in an effort to realize their ideal of infinite musical evolution under infinitely fine control and presented with infinite precision, with absolutely no concession to ‘cognitive constraints'.\" Moreover, we can see that New Complexity arose as a way to resist a contemporary simplification of compositional practice, while simultaneously pushing the envelope of music to an extreme.","lastmodified":"2022-05-06T04:42:43.878755694Z","tags":null},"/notes/vault/whence-fusion":{"title":"Whence Fusion?","content":"Jazz harmony is the theory and practice of how chords are used in jazz music. A chord [link to audio] is a harmonic set of pitches that consists of multiple notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. Jazz is similar to other practices in the tradition of Western harmony. Chord progressions [audio link] and the use of major and minor scales [audio link] as a basis for chordal construction are commonly found in both. In jazz, chords are often arranged vertically in major or minor thirds [audio link], although stacked fourths [audio link] are also often found. Furthermore, jazz includes the addition of tensions, intervals such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords [audio links]. Unlike classical music, which favors the use of triads [audio link], jazz harmony tends towards the use of seventh chords [audio link] as the basic harmonic unit.","lastmodified":"2022-05-06T04:42:43.878755694Z","tags":null}}
