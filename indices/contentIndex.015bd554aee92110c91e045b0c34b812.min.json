{"/":{"title":"Towards a New Jazz","content":"\n## A Fusionary Genre of Music\n**Abstract:**\n\u003e My project is to produce a new fusionary genre by applying the theoretical principles of jazz harmony to the school of New Complexity. New Complexity identifies an avant-garde school of composers who, since the late 1970s, have produced compositions which, while often dissonant, abstract and atonal, require inventive methods of complex notation, often overwhelming to the eyes. Through this novel integration of two seemingly disparate fields of music, I hope to honor the tradition of jazz as a continually evolving art form, consistent in its retention of idiomatic properties, both theoretical and cultural, despite flux. Eventually actualized through the creation of an original composition as well as an accompanying expository document (both of which have proven to be beyond the scope of my JW project), the kernel of my project will be accessible [here](/notes/vault/project-kernel.md). This first phase of my project, contained herein, has been to lay the groundwork for this new genre, both presentationally and practically. This site features the guiding questions, background documents, relevant resources (both audio and textual), and experimental composition excerpts. This site is otherwise a repository for all material relevant to my project. \n\n### [What is New Complexity?](/notes/vault/what-is-new-complexity.md)\n\n### [What's Experimental about New Complexity?](/notes/vault/whats-experimental-about-new-complexity.md)\n\n### [What is Jazz Harmony?](/notes/vault/what-is-jazz-harmony.md)\n\n![complexity](notes/images/complexity.png)\n\nRedman, Will. _Book_, 2006. \n\n### Documentation\n\n[|Journal Entries](/notes/vault/entries.md)  \n[|JWS Documents](/notes/vault/jws-documents.md)  \n[|References](/notes/vault/references.md)  \n[|Further Readings](/notes/vault/further-readings.md)\n\n### Content List\n\nIf you would prefer to navigate the contents of this site through an ordered list as opposed to a graph, please find a provided content list below:\n\n- [All Notes](/notes)\n\n#### Misc. \u0026 Troubleshooting\n\n- [Scheduled Maintenance](/notes/vault/maintenance.md)\n\n\u003cscript src=\"https://apps.elfsight.com/p/platform.js\" defer\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"elfsight-app-3bb82b1e-8984-4f72-9a94-b0d13f1a6a0a\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003e __*For questions or matters relating to troubleshooting, shoot me an email:*__ [Email Sam](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm\u0026to=sammeltzerthometz@gmail.com)\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-08T03:52:35.993201727Z","tags":null},"/notes/vault/Week1":{"title":"Week 1","content":"\n# Objectives: \n- Reference collection and reading\n- Refinement of scope of project\n- Learn Dorico: music notation software\n- Find a free open-source outlet to publish .md files online\n\n# Research of the Week:\nReferences Consulted and Added| \n------------ | ------------\nAder, L.

A chord is a harmonic set of pitches that consists of multiple notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. Jazz is similar to other practices in the tradition of Western harmony. Chord progressions and the use of major and minor scales as a basis for chordal construction are commonly found in both (Western harmony and Jazz specifically). In jazz, chords are often arranged vertically in major or minor thirds, although stacked fourths are also often found. Furthermore, jazz includes the addition of tensions, and intervals such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords. Unlike classical music, which favors the use of triads (3-note chords), jazz harmony tends towards the use of seventh chords (\"tetrachords\" or chords consisting of 4 notes with possible extensions comprising an \"upper structure\") as the basic harmonic unit.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-08T03:52:36.013201634Z","tags":null},"/notes/vault/what-is-new-complexity":{"title":"What is New Complexity?","content":"\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYMXbM0RCeU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nA brief history of New Complexity must include the names Brian Ferneyhough, Michael Finnissy, Chris Dench, and Richard Barrett, each with their own sonic and philosophical worlds, and all of whom came together in the 1980s under the term \"the New Complexity.\" New Complexity came to mean \"a lotta notes.\" \n\n![score](https://towardsanewjazz.com/notes/images/score.jpeg)\n\nIn his doctoral dissertation, Stuart Duncan corrects the notion that complexity in music has to do with densely notated scores, often referred to as \"black scores,\" so filled with notations that one can hardly discern the music in this tangle of information. Instead, Duncan asks: Where does complexity reside, if not in intensely complex notation? In other words, what is meant by complexity? \"Complexity,\" he clarifies, \"resides in the interstices between the composer and the score, score and performance, and performance and reception, in whose confluence 'the work' might be said to exist\".\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e Elaborating on this idea, the musicologist Harry Halbrich cautions us that we should not confuse complexity with complication, and that complexity is, he suggests, \"a prerequisite of any great art wishing to satisfy not only the sense and feelings, but also the mind.\"\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e New Complexity music, moreover, foregrounds what is cognitive about music by elaborating upon its theoretical premises to a new extreme.\n\n__  \n*(1) Barry Truax, “The Inner and Outer Complexity of Music,” Perspectives of New Music 32, no. 1 (1994): 176.*\n\n*(2) Duncan, S.

Ferneyhough was born in 1943 in England and taught at various institutions in the United States until landing at Stanford University, where he is now Professor Emeritus. There exists an enormous amount of discussion around Ferneyhough's intense intellectualism: he has been called a \"peculiarly mystifying verbalizer\" with a \"fearsome theoretical background.\" \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://towardsanewjazz.com/notes/images/ferneyhough.jpeg\"\u003e\n\nIf we can see past this haze of fearful and superficial responses to his work, we can begin to understand the ways in which New Complexity is fundamentally committed to exploring, in a deeply experimental way, the relationship between the musical score, the musical performance, and the cognitive experience of music. According to James Boros, New Complexity grew as a reaction against the “new simplicity,” with “composers and performers who, having peeked over the fence surrounding this dungheap, have determined that shoveling shit is not to be their fate.”\n\n![time](https://towardsanewjazz.com/notes/images/time.jpeg)\n\nAccording to the American musicologist Richard Taruskin, the complexity of the work of composers like Ferneyhough and others represents an effort to find \"notations for virtually impalpable microtones, ever-changing rhythmic divisions and tiny gradations of timbre and loudness in an effort to realize their ideal of infinite musical evolution under infinitely fine control and presented with infinite precision, with absolutely no concession to ‘cognitive constraints'.\" Moreover, we can see that New Complexity arose as a way to resist a contemporary simplification of compositional practice, while simultaneously pushing the envelope of music to an extreme. \n\n__  \n*(1) Duncan, S.
